\description{
The spatial enrichment (SpEn) is designed to detect spatially enriched or depleted biomolecules (genes, proteins, etc) for chosen spatial features (cellular compartments, tissues, organs, \emph{etc}). It compares each feature with all other reference features. The biomolecules significantly up- or down-regulated in one feature relative to reference features are denoted spatially enriched or depleted respectively. The underlying differential expression analysis methods include edgeR (Robinson et al, 2010), limma (Ritchie et al, 2015), and DESeq2 (Love et al, 2014). By querying a feature of interest from the enrichment results, the enriched or depleted biomolecules will be returned. \cr In addition, the SpEn is also able to identify biomolecules enriched or depleted in experiment vairables in a similar manner.   

`sf_var()` subsets data according to given spatial features and variables.

`spatial_enrich()` detects enriched or depleted biomolecules for each given spatial feature.

`query_enrich()` queries enriched or depleted biomolecules in the enrichment results returned by \code{spatial_enrich} for a chosen spatial feature.

`ovl_enrich()` plots overlap of enrichment results across spatial features in form an upset plot, overlap matrix, or Venn diagram.

`graph_line()` plots expression values of chosen biomolecules in a line graph.

\examples{

## In the following examples, the toy data come from an RNA-seq analysis on development of 7
## chicken organs under 9 time points (Cardoso-Moreira et al. 2019). For conveninece, it is
## included in this package. The complete raw count data are downloaded using the R package
## ExpressionAtlas (Keays 2019) with the accession number "E-MTAB-6769".

# A targets file describing spatial features and conditions is required for toy data. It should be made
# based on the experiment design, which is accessible through the accession number 
# "E-MTAB-6769" in the R package ExpressionAtlas. An example targets file is included in this
# package and accessed below. 

# Access the example targets file.

## As conventions, raw sequencing count data should be normalized and filtered to
## reduce noise. Since normalization will be performed in spatial enrichment, only filtering
## is required.

# retained.

              conveying cargos along microtubules. KIF5s, the heavy chains of
              conventional kinesin (KHC), are originally identified members of
              KIFs, and neuronal KIF5A and ubiquitous KIF5B have been
              identified so far. In the present work, we cloned a novel member
              of KIF5, KIF5C, and generated specific antibodies against three
              KIF5s to investigate their distribution and functions. KIF5A
              showed pan-neuronal distribution in the nervous system. KIF5B
              showed a glial cell distribution pattern in general; however,
              interestingly, its expression was strongly upregulated in
              axon-elongating neurons, such as olfactory primary neurons and
              mossy fibers. KIF5C was also a neuronal KIF5 like KIF5A but was
              highly expressed in lower motor neurons in 2-week-old or older
              mice, suggesting its important roles in the maintenance of motor
              neurons rather than in their formation, such as axonal
              elongation. Because a large part of KIF5s in adult motor neurons
              were expected to be KIF5C, we generated mice lacking the kif5C
              gene to investigate the functions of KIF5C in neurons in living
              animals. The mutant mice showed smaller brain size but were
              viable and did not show gross changes in the nervous system.
              Closer examinations revealed the relative loss of motor neurons
              to sensory neurons. Because three KIF5s showed high similarity in
              the amino acid sequence, could rescue the KIF5B mutant cells, and
              could form heterodimers, we think that there are functional
              redundancy among the three KIF5s and that KIF5A and KIF5B
              prevented the KIF5C null mice from the severe phenotype.",

              the biological functions of GRIK3 in malignancies are largely
              unknown because of limited related studies. Here, we primarily
              reported that the expression of GRIK3 was higher in breast cancer
              tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues. GRIK3 expression
              was also positively correlated with the prognosis of patients
              with breast cancer. GRIK3 promoted the proliferation and
              migration abilities of breast cancer cells and enhanced the
              growth of orthotopically implanted tumors. Mechanically, GRIK3
              influenced a range of signaling pathways and key signal
              transducers, including two epithelial-mesenchymal transition
              regulators, SPDEF and CDH1. Heterogenous expression of SPDEF and
              CDH1 counteracted the migration and invasion abilities,
              respectively, of breast cancer cells induced by GRIK3. Moreover,
              overexpression of GRIK3 increased the expression of mesenchymal
              markers and decreased the expression of epithelial markers,
              resulting in the translocation of $\beta$-catenin into the
              nucleus and the increased $\beta$-catenin transcriptional
              activity. In conclusion, the present study reported a novel
              oncogenic role of GRIK3. Meanwhile, GRIK3, as a membrane

  abstract = "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in complex pathological
              reactions, where the initial lesion is followed by secondary
              inflammation and edema. Our laboratory and others have reported
              that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have efficacy in
              improving recovery from traumatic brain injury in mice. Treatment
              of mice with a subhypotensive dose of the ARB candesartan results
              in improved functional recovery, and reduced pathology (lesion
              volume, inflammation and gliosis). In order to gain a better
              understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which
              candesartan improves recovery after controlled cortical impact
              injury (CCI), we performed transcriptomic profiling on brain
              regions after injury and drug treatment. We examined RNA
              expression in the ipsilateral hippocampus, thalamus and
              hypothalamus at 3 or 29 days post injury (dpi) treated with
              either candesartan (0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle. RNA was isolated and
              analyzed by bulk mRNA-seq. Gene expression in injured and/or
              candesartan treated brain region was compared to that in sham
              vehicle treated mice in the same brain region to identify genes
              that were differentially expressed (DEGs) between groups. The
              most DEGs were expressed in the hippocampus at 3 dpi, and the
              number of DEGs reduced with distance and time from the lesion.
              Among pathways that were differentially expressed at 3 dpi after
              CCI, candesartan treatment altered genes involved in
              angiogenesis, interferon signaling, extracellular matrix
              regulation including integrins and chromosome maintenance and DNA
              replication. At 29 dpi, candesartan treatment reduced the
              expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response. Some
              changes in gene expression were confirmed in a separate cohort of
              animals by qPCR. Fewer DEGs were found in the thalamus, and only
              one in the hypothalamus at 3 dpi. Additionally, in the hippocampi
              of sham injured mice, 3 days of candesartan treatment led to the
              differential expression of 384 genes showing that candesartan in
              the absence of injury had a powerful impact on gene expression
              specifically in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that
              candesartan has broad actions in the brain after injury and
              affects different processes at acute and chronic times after
              injury. These data should assist in elucidating the beneficial
              effect of candesartan on recovery from TBI.",

              which cell types are represented in whole-kidney RNA-Seq data in
              order to identify circumstances in which bulk-kidney RNA-Seq can
              be successfully interpreted. We carried out RNA-Seq in mouse
              whole kidneys and in microdissected renal tubule segments. To aid
              in the interpretation of the data, we compiled a database of
              cell-type selective protein markers for 43 cell types believed to
              be present in kidney tissue. The whole-kidney RNA-Seq analysis
              identified transcripts corresponding to 17,742 genes, distributed

               whole-brain spatial transcriptomics. We found that the molecular

               in male offspring. A single injection of ALLO or muscimol, a
               GABAAR agonist, during late gestation abolished these

              all multicellular organisms. Yet, much is unknown regarding how a
              cell traverses the pathway from stem cell to terminal
              differentiation. Advances in single cell genomics[1][1] hold
              promise for unraveling developmental mechanisms[2][2]--[3][3] in
              tissues[4][4], organs[5][5]--[6][6], and organisms[7][7]--[8][8].
              However, lineage tracing can be challenging for some
              tissues[9][9] and integration of high-quality datasets is often
              necessary to detect rare cell populations and developmental
              states[10][10],[11][11]. Here, we harmonized single cell mRNA
              sequencing data from over 110,000 cells to construct a
              comprehensive atlas for a stereotypically developing organ with
              indeterminate growth, the Arabidopsis root. To test the utility
              of the atlas to interpret new datasets, we profiled mutants for
              two key transcriptional regulators at single cell resolution,
              shortroot and scarecrow . Although both transcription factors are
              required for early specification of cell identity[12][12], our
              results suggest the existence of an alternative pathway acting in
              mature cells to specify endodermal identity, for which SHORTROOT
              is required. Uncovering the architecture of this pathway will
              provide insight into specification and stabilization of the
              endodermis, a tissue analogous to the mammalian epithelium. Thus,
              the atlas is a pivotal advance for unraveling the transcriptional
              programs that specify and maintain cell identity to regulate
              organ development in space and time. \#\#\# Competing Interest

              comprehensive dataset of gene expression from individual cell
              types of the Arabidopsis root. Comparisons across cell types

              carried out to uncover the features that are essential for
              germination and early seedling growth under anoxic conditions.
              Temporal analysis of the transcriptome and methylome from
              germination to young seedlings under aerobic and anaerobic
              conditions revealed 82\% similarity in the transcriptome and no
              differences in the epigenome up to 24 h. Following germination,
              significant changes in the transcriptome and DNA methylation were
              observed between 4-day aerobically and anaerobically grown
              coleoptiles. A link between the epigenomic state and cell
              division versus cell elongation is suggested, as no differences
              in DNA methylation were observed between 24-h aerobically and
              anaerobically germinating embryos, when there is little cell
              division. After that, epigenetic changes appear to correlate with
              differences between cell elongation (anaerobic conditions) versus
              cell division (aerobic conditions) in the coleoptiles.
              Re-oxygenation of 3-day anaerobically grown seedlings resulted in
              rapid transcriptomic changes in DNA methylation in these
              coleoptiles. Unlike the transcriptome, changes in DNA methylation
              upon re-oxygenation did not reflect those seen in aerobic
              coleoptiles, but instead, reverted to a pattern similar to dry
              seeds. Reversion to the ?dry seed? state of DNA methylation upon
              re-oxygenation may act to ?reset the clock? for the rapid
              molecular changes and cell division that result upon

              disciplines lack similar tools. Moreover, web based tools often
              lack the modularity associated with packages in programming
              languages, such as R. Here I present gganatogram, an R package
              used to plot modular species anatograms based on a combination of
              the graphical grammar of ggplot2 and the publicly available
              anatograms from the Expression Atlas. This combination allows for
              quick and easy, modular, and reproducible generation of
              anatograms. Using only one command and a data frame with tissue
              name, group, colour, and value, this tool enables the user to
              visualise specific human and mouse tissues with desired colours,
              grouped by a variable, or displaying a desired value, such as
              gene-expression, pharmacokinetics, or bacterial load across
              selected tissues. gganatogram consists of 5 highly annotated
              organisms, male/female human/mouse, and a cell anatogram. It
              further consists of 24 other less annotated organisms from the
              animal and plant kingdom. I hope that this tool will be useful by
              the wider community in biological sciences. Community members are
              welcome to submit additional anatograms, which can be
              incorporated into the package. A stable version gganatogram has
              been deposited to neuroconductor, and a development version can
              be found on github/jespermaag/gganatogram. An interactive shiny

              other high-throughput projects for hypothesis generation has
              become a vital aspect of post-genomic research. For the
              non-bioinformatics specialist, however, many of the currently
              available tools provide overwhelming amounts of data that are
              presented in a non-intuitive way. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              In order to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of
              microarray data and data from other large-scale data sets, we
              have developed a tool, which we have dubbed the electronic
              Fluorescent Pictograph - or eFP - Browser, available at
              http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/, for exploring microarray and other
              data for hypothesis generation. This eFP Browser engine paints
              data from large-scale data sets onto pictographic representations
              of the experimental samples used to generate the data sets. We
              give examples of using the tool to present Arabidopsis gene

              large-scale data sets from any organism and thus should prove

              transcription factor (TF) family member mRNAs that was markedly
              reconfigured by hypoxia at global and cell-specific levels. In
              addition to the demonstration of the complexity and plasticity of
              cell-specific populations of ribosome-associated mRNAs, this

              and signaling, yet little is understood as to how progress
              through these events is regulated. Here, we explored the
              phenotypic and transcriptional events involved in the acclimation
              of the Arabidopsis thaliana seedling root to a rapid change in
              salinity. Using live-imaging analysis, we show that growth is
              dynamically regulated with a period of quiescence followed by
              recovery then homeostasis. Through the use of a new
              high-resolution spatio-temporal transcriptional map, we identify
              the key hormone signaling pathways that regulate specific
              transcriptional programs, predict their spatial domain of action,
              and link the activity of these pathways to the regulation of
              specific phases of growth. We use tissue-specific approaches to
              suppress the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway and
              demonstrate that ABA likely acts in select tissue layers to
              regulate spatially localized transcriptional programs and promote
              growth recovery. Finally, we show that salt also regulates many
              tissue-specific and time point-specific transcriptional responses
              that are expected to modify water transport, Casparian strip
              formation, and protein translation. Together, our data reveal a
              sophisticated assortment of regulatory programs acting together
              to coordinate spatially patterned biological changes involved in
              the immediate and long-term response to a stressful shift in

              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external
              software. Along with the R package we also present R software
              tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene
              expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be
              applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA
              package provides R functions for weighted correlation network
              analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression
              data. The R package along with its source code and additional
              material are freely available at
